# Java
my old Java code from when I was first learning.

while I did leave notation and at the time I wrote the code in this repo I did give a lot of effort and some may find the notes useful when they are taking a class for intro to java, this is mostly only up so I can look back and laugh at myself more and more as time goes by. Some of this stuff amazes me in a not so brilliant way as much as it does in a refusal to accept that I went about things in that much of a roundabout way when attempting to resolve issues.
