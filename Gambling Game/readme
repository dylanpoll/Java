This is one of the real crazy rides from when I was first learning java. 
There is so much to point out here I don't even know where to start so there is without a doubt no defence. 

Does it work? yes.. But when you see how and what I did from a lack of knowing about the tools out there... take for example the entire application gets its core assets loaded by a try catch with a known null pointer error and every method is a void in the entire application.

Oh and the odds for the innitial assets and the funds for the player where assigned values to use for them in the rubric for the class I was taking, I think my proffessor was trying to drive home that gambling is bad and you will lose all your money..
