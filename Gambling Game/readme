This is one of the real crazy rides from when I was first learning java. 
There is so much to point out here I don't even know where to start so there is without a doubt no defence. 

Does it work? yes.. But when you see how and what I did from a lack of knowing about the tools out there... take for example the entire application gets its core assets loaded by a try catch with a known null pointer error and every method is a void in the entire application.
